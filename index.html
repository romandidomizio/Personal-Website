            <!-- Main Narrative -->
            <div class="main-narrative">
                <h2 class="content-subheading">My Journey</h2>
                <p>My path into technology started with a Computer Science degree from CU Boulder. Early on, I discovered a passion for how different fields intersect, blending elegant design principles with the immersive experiences of gaming and the solid engineering of full-stack development. To me, these are not isolated skills but complementary parts of a whole. Crafting an intuitive user experience in a complex simulation shares the same core challenges as in a compelling game. My work building full-stack applications has given me a deep understanding of how to translate these ideas into reality, from database architecture to the final user interface.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subheading">AI in Action</h2>
                <p>This integrated view naturally led me to artificial intelligence. As a <strong>Technical Product Manager Intern</strong> at The Verse, I am immersed in AI product strategy for an emotionally intelligent therapeutic platform. My responsibilities include architecting AI roadmaps from the ground up and developing innovative LLM simulation systems. This role is very hands on, involving direct work with <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>, orchestrating multi agent systems using tools like <strong>LangGraph</strong>, and diving into techniques such as <strong>RLHF</strong> and <strong>LoRA/QLoRA fine tuning</strong> to build agents with high emotional intelligence. My focus is on creating dynamic systems that not only interact but also learn, adapt, and truly comprehend the context of their decisions. This often involves close collaboration with engineering and research teams to bring these complex systems to life.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subheading">Future Focus: Aerospace & Defense</h2>
                <p>My fascination with intelligent, adaptive systems drives my interest in the significant challenges of autonomy, particularly within the <strong>aerospace and defense sectors</strong>. The impact of AI in this domain is profound, offering the potential to revolutionize capabilities from intelligent reconnaissance and autonomous navigation to sophisticated decision support systems. I am committed to contributing to an environment where robust and ethically aligned AI can enhance national security and open new frontiers. My ambition is to be at the leading edge of this field, involved in the complete lifecycle: planning, designing, building, and managing the development of these pioneering AI and autonomous technologies.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subheading">Education & Strategic Goals</h2>
                <p>To deepen this interdisciplinary expertise, I am currently pursuing a <strong>Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence</strong> and a <strong>Graduate Certificate in Engineering Management</strong> at CU Boulder. This dual program provides me with advanced AI knowledge and the strategic leadership, product strategy, and systems thinking skills essential for spearheading ambitious projects. I am actively seeking <strong>Technical Product Manager</strong> roles where I can apply this combination of deep technical understanding, design intuition, and strategic insight to deliver impactful AI solutions.</p>

                 <h2 class="content-subheading">Beyond Tech</h2>
                 <p>Beyond my technical pursuits, I balanced my undergraduate studies as a D1 ACHA hockey player. I continue to enjoy staying active, whether it's on the ice, snowboarding, hiking, biking, or at the gym.</p>
