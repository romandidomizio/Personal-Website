            <!-- Elevator Pitch -->
            <p class="elevator-pitch">
                an AI product leader and engineer focused on architecting intelligent, agentic systems. My full-stack computer science background provides a systems-level perspective, allowing me to lead product strategy, define technical roadmaps, and execute with hands-on development. I am driven to solve complex challenges by researching, designing, and building the next generation of autonomous systems.

            <!-- Main Narrative -->
            <div class="main-narrative">
                <h2 class="content-subheading">My Journey</h2>
                <p>My path into technology started with a computer science degree from CU Boulder. Early on, I discovered a passion for how different fields intersect, blending elegant design principles with the immersive experiences of gaming and the solid engineering of full-stack development. To me, these are not isolated skills but complementary parts of a whole. Crafting an intuitive user experience in a complex simulation shares the same core challenges as in a compelling game. My work building full-stack applications has given me a deep understanding of how to translate these ideas into reality, from database architecture to the final user interface.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subheading">AI in Action</h2>
                <p>This perspective is the foundation of my work in artificial intelligence. At The Verse, I lead the AI initiative for WalkXR, a gamified therapeutic platform. My role is to own the product vision and technical strategy, translating the concept of an emotionally intelligent companion into a concrete agentic framework.</p>
                <p>This means architecting the entire system. I designed the product roadmap to scale from a single agent MVP to a multi agent OS. I also architected and built a novel LLM simulation system to generate the synthetic data we need for effective agent training and evaluation. It's a hands on leadership role where I define the core technical strategy for our OS, using tools like LangGraph for multi agent orchestration and RAG for knowledge grounding, while also prototyping the foundational agent capabilities myself.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subheading">Future Focus</h2>
                <p>My work architecting agentic frameworks has clarified my long term focus. The core principles of building systems that perceive, reason, and act are the same ones that drive the future of autonomy. I see a direct line from my experience with multi agent systems to the complex challenges in aerospace and defense, such as autonomous navigation, intelligent reconnaissance, and sophisticated human AI teaming.</p>
                <p>My goal is to apply my skills in AI strategy and systems architecture to these critical domains. I am pursuing roles where I can contribute to the entire lifecycle of these technologies, from initial design and prototyping to product management and deployment. Whether as a software engineer building the core systems or as a product manager guiding the strategic vision, my focus remains the same: to build robust, reliable, and impactful autonomous systems.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subheading">Education Goals</h2>
                <p>To deepen this interdisciplinary expertise, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and a Graduate Certificate in Engineering Management at CU Boulder. This dual program provides me with advanced AI knowledge and the strategic leadership, product strategy, and systems thinking skills essential for spearheading ambitious projects. I am actively seeking technical product manager or software engineering roles where I can apply this combination of deep technical understanding, design intuition, and strategic insight to deliver impactful AI solutions.</p>

                 <h2 class="content-subheading">Beyond Tech</h2>
                 <p>Beyond my technical pursuits, I balanced my undergraduate studies as a D1 ACHA hockey player. I continue to enjoy staying active, whether it's on the ice, snowboarding, hiking, biking, or at the gym.</p>
