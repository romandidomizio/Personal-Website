            <div class="main-narrative">
                <h2 class="content-subheading">My Journey</h2>
                <p>My path into technology started with a Computer Science degree from CU Boulder. Early on, I discovered a passion for how different fields intersect, blending elegant design principles with the immersive experiences of gaming and the solid engineering of full-stack development. To me, these are not isolated skills but complementary parts of a whole. Crafting an intuitive user experience in a complex simulation shares the same core challenges as in a compelling game. My work building full-stack applications has given me a deep understanding of how to translate these ideas into reality, from database architecture to the final user interface.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subheading">AI in Action</h2>
                <p>This integrated view naturally led me to artificial intelligence. As a <strong>Technical Product Manager Intern</strong> at The Verse, I am immersed in AI product strategy for an emotionally intelligent therapeutic platform. My responsibilities include architecting AI roadmaps from the ground up and developing innovative LLM simulation systems. This role is very hands on, involving direct work with <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong>, orchestrating multi agent systems using tools like <strong>LangGraph</strong>, and diving into techniques such as <strong>RLHF</strong> and <strong>LoRA/QLoRA fine tuning</strong> to build agents with high emotional intelligence. My focus is on creating dynamic systems that not only interact but also learn, adapt, and truly comprehend the context of their decisions. This often involves close collaboration with engineering and research teams to bring these complex systems to life.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subheading">Future Focus: A Strategic Path to Impact</h2>
                <p>My interest in intelligent, adaptive systems is driving me to pursue significant challenges in autonomy. Fields like aerospace and defense are prime examples where AI can create profound change, transforming areas such as intelligent reconnaissance, autonomous navigation, and complex decision support. I also see similar, exciting opportunities for transformation in other critical industries. My commitment is to contribute to work environments where robust, ethically-sound AI improves safety, boosts efficiency, and creates new avenues for innovation. I plan to be at the forefront of this work, involved in the entire lifecycle from planning and designing to building and managing these pioneering AI and autonomous technologies. My clear long-term aspiration is to apply my growing expertise in the aerospace and defense sector.</p>
                <p>My current role as a Technical Product Manager Intern is a vital part of this journey. Itâ€™s not just theoretical learning; I am actively involved in <strong>AI product strategy</strong>, <strong>shaping roadmaps</strong>, <strong>leading cross-functional teams</strong>, and, importantly, translating complex technical work, like the <strong>LLM simulations</strong> and <strong>RAG systems</strong> I've architected, into real-world, viable products. This daily experience teaches me how to navigate the practical complexities of launching AI solutions. The skills I'm honing here, such as <strong>problem-solving</strong>, <strong>strategic thinking</strong>, and <strong>technical communication</strong>, are directly transferable whether I am engineering software, managing products in an enterprise context, or developing specialized AI systems. This hands-on work is building my adaptability and provides a strong foundation for several complementary career directions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Software Engineering Roles:</strong> My foundation in full-stack development and computer science is strong. I aim to deepen this technical expertise by building and scaling <strong>robust software systems</strong>, particularly those that use <strong>AI/ML</strong>, process <strong>large amounts of data</strong>, or enable <strong>autonomous functions</strong>. This could be in enterprise software, on specialized AI platforms, or within robotics. In these roles, I can directly apply my understanding of <strong>system architecture</strong> and my experience in creating <strong>user-focused designs</strong> that I've cultivated since my early projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Product Management (Enterprise/AI):</strong> Building on my current TPM experience, I want to expand my <strong>product leadership capabilities</strong>. I'm particularly interested in roles focused on enterprise SaaS, AI-powered tools, or platforms for autonomous systems. My current work in <strong>AI strategy</strong>, coupled with my skills in <strong>market analysis</strong> and <strong>user-centric design (UI/UX)</strong>, would allow me to effectively manage the <strong>complete product lifecycle</strong> for these advanced technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Specialized AI/ML/Autonomy Roles:</strong> I am keen to further apply and expand my practical experience with technologies like <strong>RAG</strong>, <strong>LangGraph</strong>, and <strong>LLM fine-tuning</strong>. Roles that involve the development, research, or direct application of AI, machine learning, or autonomous systems across various industries would allow me to contribute my skills to areas like <strong>intelligent perception systems</strong>, sophisticated <strong>decision-making algorithms</strong>, or intuitive <strong>human-AI interaction</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>My core strengths lie in <strong>software development</strong>, a practical and growing understanding of <strong>AI/ML systems</strong>, a keen eye for effective <strong>UI/UX</strong>, and a genuine passion for <strong>autonomous technologies</strong>. This combination makes me a versatile candidate, ready for roles that demand both solid technical knowledge and clear strategic thinking. I see each step in my career as a deliberate opportunity to gain new skills and perspectives. All these experiences are converging on my ultimate goal: to design, build, and manage <strong>transformative AI technologies</strong> that solve <strong>critical, real-world problems</strong>.</p>

                <h2 class="content-subheading">Education Goals</h2>
                <p>To deepen this interdisciplinary expertise, I am currently pursuing a <strong>Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence</strong> and a <strong>Graduate Certificate in Engineering Management</strong> at CU Boulder. This dual program provides me with advanced AI knowledge and the strategic leadership, product strategy, and systems thinking skills essential for spearheading ambitious projects. I am actively seeking <strong>Technical Product Manager</strong> and <strong>Software Engineering</strong> roles where I can apply this combination of deep technical understanding, design intuition, and strategic insight to deliver impactful AI solutions.</p>

                 <h2 class="content-subheading">Beyond Tech</h2>
                 <p>Beyond my technical pursuits, I balanced my undergraduate studies as a D1 ACHA hockey player. I continue to enjoy staying active, whether it's on the ice, snowboarding, hiking, biking, or at the gym.</p>
